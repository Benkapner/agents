# Post-script: push the fix agent's commit and process structured output.
#
# Runs on the GitHub Actions / GitLab CI runner AFTER the sandbox is destroyed.
# This script has write access to the target repo — it is the most
# security-sensitive component in the fix pipeline.
#
# Security layers (defense-in-depth):
#   - Authoritative secret scan — final gate before any push
#   - Auto-install pre-commit tool deps (from .pre-commit-tools.yaml)
#   - Authoritative pre-commit — run repo hooks on changed files
#   - Branch validation — refuse to push main/master
#   - Token isolation — PUSH_TOKEN never enters the sandbox
#
# Protected-path enforcement lives in post-review.sh: the review agent
# cannot approve PRs that touch sensitive paths (e.g. .github/, CODEOWNERS,
# agents/). The fix agent is free to propose changes to any path.
#
# Steps:
#   0. Check for agent commits
#   1. Authoritative secret scan
#   2. Auto-install pre-commit tool deps (from .pre-commit-tools.yaml)
#   3. Authoritative pre-commit check
#   4. Push branch
#   5. Process structured output
#   6. Iteration-cap warning label
#   7. Summary
#
# After pushing, this script processes agent-result.json to:
#   - Post a summary comment on the PR documenting fixes and disagreements
#   - Apply labels (needs-human) if the iteration cap is approaching
#
# Required environment variables:
#   PUSH_TOKEN        — token with contents:write + issues:write + pull-requests:write
#                       on target repo (GitHub App installation token, PAT,
#                       or GitLab personal/project access token)
#   REPO_FULL_NAME    — owner/repo
#   PR_NUMBER         — PR number
#   REPO_DIR          — path to extracted repo (default: current directory)
#   TRIGGER_SOURCE    — forge username that triggered the fix (GitHub: [bot] suffix; GitLab: _bot suffix)
#
# Optional environment variables:
#   FIX_ITERATION     — current iteration count
#   ITERATION_CAP     — max iterations (default: 5)
#   PUSH_TOKEN_SOURCE — "github-app" (for logging)
#   HUMAN_INSTRUCTION — the harness-captured /fs-fix comment text (only for
#                       human-triggered runs); used to confirm a rebase or
#                       squash/redo was actually requested before trusting
#                       rebased_onto_target / history_rewritten
#   FIX_CONFLICT_UPDATE_STRATEGY
#                     — merge (default) or rebase; how to publish a
#                       forge-reported merge conflict the agent reconciled
#   POST_FAILURE_DETAIL_MAX_LINES
#                     — max lines of failure detail in issue/PR comments (default: 30)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — branch pushed, PR updated
#   1  — validation failure or error (nothing pushed)

  # forces git itself to print one (the diff against the merge's first
  # parent). Content that only exists because of the merge itself — i.e. the
  # forge-conflict resolution — is therefore invisible to the scan above.
  # Scan each merge's *combined* diff — `git show`'s default format for a
  # merge commit (equivalent to `--cc`), which includes only blobs that
  # differ from every parent — so only the actual conflict-resolution
  # content is checked. A pairwise `-m --first-parent` diff dumps the entire
  # incoming-target tree delta (every file the merge brought in, whether or
  # not it was touched by conflict resolution), including target-branch
  # content this PR never modified — a secret already on the target branch
  # would then false-fail this authoritative gate and block publishing a
  # legitimate conflict merge.
  #
  # `--cc` is only safe when EVERY non-first parent of the merge is actually
  # part of trusted target-branch history: combined-diff format omits any
  # path whose merge-result blob matches *any* parent, not just the one
  # checked. Checking only `^2` is incomplete for a merge with more than two
  # parents — a third (or later) parent that cleanly adds a file (no
  # conflict) would never appear in `--cc` output even though it was never
  # verified as trusted. MERGE_COMMITS_IN_RANGE is limited to the agent's
  # own first-parent merge(s), but nothing else guarantees every parent of a
  # given merge actually IS trusted target-branch history — a compromised
  # sandboxed agent could create a different (possibly octopus) merge during
  # the same session (e.g. of a throwaway branch carrying a planted secret)
  # and `--cc` would silently miss a cleanly-added file. Walk every non-first
  # parent (`^2`, `^3`, ... until `git rev-parse` fails) and require each one
  # to be an ancestor of TRUSTED_TARGET_SHA (fetched fresh, not the mutable
  # local ref) before trusting `--cc`; fall back to the full pairwise
  # first-parent diff whenever any extra parent is missing, unresolvable, or
  # not trusted-target history, since that diff captures everything the
  # merge brought in regardless of conflict status.
  # Materialize the diff to a file rather than piping `git show` straight
  # into `gitleaks --pipe`: with `set -o pipefail` (enabled at the top of
